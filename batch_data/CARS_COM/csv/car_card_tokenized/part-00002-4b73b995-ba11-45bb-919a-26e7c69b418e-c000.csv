Bold sculpting gives our Malibu's design a distinctive look that goes well with Redline upgrades like LED taillamps, black Bowtie emblems, a blacked-out grille, black mirror caps with Redline graphics, and 19-inch black alloy wheels with red hash marks. You can enjoy impressive comfort and convenience in our LT cabin with heated premium-cloth front seats, eight-way power for the driver, our Redline Pack's wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, keyless access, remote start, and pushbutton ignition. Connecting on the go is vital for today's drivers, so our Malibu makes technology easy with an 8-inch touchscreen, WiFi compatibility, wireless Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, voice command, Bluetooth, and six-speaker audio. Chevrolet adds key features for your safety, too, including a rearview camera, lane-keeping assistance, automatic braking, forward collision alert, a rear-seat reminder, 10 airbags, ABS, stability/traction control, tire pressure monitoring, and more.

BENEFITS OF HONDA CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED VEHICLES: Only high-quality vehicles qualify  Not just any used Honda can be designated as a HondaTrue Certified Pre-Owned car, truck, or SUV. Vehicles must meet strict criteria and have a clean vehicle history report. CPO vehicles come with warranty coverage  Buying a regular used car often means that you are purchasing a vehicle without a warranty. A CPO Honda vehicle comes with a 7-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty in addition to non-powertrain coverage. They are more affordable  HondaTrue CPO vehicles are in like-new condition without the hefty new car price tag. This means you can likely upgrade to a higher trim level that may be out of budget if you were shopping for a new model. Roadside Assistance Adds Peace of Mind  You no longer have to fear unexpected automotive issues when you choose a CPO Honda",2023-05-04T08:16:50.000Z,cars.com scrapper,2023-05-04T15:28:00.859Z

Corwin is a family owned and operated business. We have been in business for over 100 years. Our select Certified inventory takes the risk out of buying a car at the same live market price. All our preowned vehicles get 172 point inspection by certified technicians. You get a Vehicle History Report. Now that's a deal! What is Live Market Pricing? We utilize a 3rd party company, Kelly Blue Book, to help us price preowned vehicles. To not be just the best price, but the best value price. Which in turn takes the haggle out of buying a car. Saving you TIME and MONEY. Remember if it does not say Corwin on the back of the car, you've probably paid to much. We proudly serve Republic, Ozark, Nixa, Fair Grove, Pleasant Hope, Billings, Clever, Springfield, Aurora, Branson, Marshfield, and the greater Springfield Missouri area.

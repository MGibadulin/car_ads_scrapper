We utilize a 3rd party company, Kelly Blue Book, to help us price preowned vehicles. To not be just the best price, but the best value price. Which in turn takes the haggle out of buying a car. Saving you TIME and MONEY. Remember if it does not say Corwin on the back of the car, you've probably paid to much.
